	    		<p class="left">
	    			As of December 2015, <a class="text-link dark" href="http://debatecamp.co" target="_blank">debatecamp.co</a> had to be taken offline due to some disagreements with my client and an organization they were affiliated with. While I regret that I cannot show the live site, I've provided a small image gallery to show off what it looked like in the short 3 months it was online.

	    		<h2 class="left">problem</h2>
	    		<p class="left">
	    		My client approached me with a proposal for a supposedly simple website needed as promotional material for an event he was organizing later in the year. It was emphasized in our talks that it absolutely <em>had</em> to be delivered &quot;by next Friday,&quot; effectively giving me about <strong>6 days</strong> to bring the whole project to production.

	    		<h2 class="right">my solution</h2>
	    		<p class="right">
	    		Judging by how easy my last project was with the Foundation framework, I figured it couldn't hurt to give it another try. With some more exploration into Foundation's features and its reusable Building Blocks, the construction of the DCA 2015 website became much more efficient.

	    		<p class="left">
	    		With the deadline effectively hanging over my head, there was little time to lay solid groundwork for the website's structure and information architecture. Thankfully, the one who put me in contact with the client happened to be an old highschool friend of mine, who also happened to be on board with this project (which was why he called me, I imagine). His role for the promotional materials was photo editor and translator -- all the images and text written on the site would first go through him. After some discussion, we settled that the client's requirements would give us material for 5 pages: <em>Home</em>, <em>About</em>, <em>Staff</em>, <em>Details</em>, and <em>Register</em>.

	    		<h2 class="left">execution</h2>
	    		<p class="left">
	    		The first few meetings with my partner, Aaron, were quite smooth. By the end of our day 1 work session, the site's information architecture and most of the content had been written out and ready to go. After day 2, some moderately styled pages were completed with accompanying photos, giving us some optimism about the pace of the entire project.<br><br>

	    		Unfortunately, some turbulence occurred during our development. Due to a lack of initial communication to the client, I was not informed that the event planning was <em>not yet finalized</em>, and that the list of scheduled activities was subject to change. On top of this, new requests appeared for functionality on the site that wasn't initially mentioned. Now the site required a page for a debate tournament, a way to track registration with payment, and media galleries promoting other events from the same organization.<br><br>

	    		Despite the new requirements and unchanged deadline, Aaron and I pushed forward. Thanks to his incredible talent for editing and my familiarity with my framework's tools, we delivered the site on time. Some emergency workarounds involving Google Sheets and PayPal were necessary to satisfy the registration requirements, but thankfully all the technologies involved remained stable.

	    		<h2 class="right">reflection</h2>
	    		<p class="right">
	    		Debate Camp America's website was a gauntlet of a week for me. Most of the time was spent in a small coffee shop along North road (<a class="text-link dark" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Coffee-Monster/415413655278190" target="_blank">Coffee Monster</a>; try their affogato!), working from the afternoon until long after sundown.<br><br>

	    		As my first <strong>freelance</strong> job, I have to say I have a new appreciation for people who dedicate their lives to this style of work. It's incredibly difficult keeping up with changing demands, fast deadlines, and cramped schedules. There are definitely areas where I could have planned ahead better. A CMS like Drupal or WordPress may have taken a bit of setup work to do, but their structure would have suited the client's needs quite well, the full site requirements should have been a condition of my employment, and the hosting services should have been provided earlier in the project timeline.<br><br>

	    		Now that it's been delivered and the maintenance responsibilities of DCA 2015 are behind me, I feel like I've learned a lot about a piece of the web industry that I've always been curious about.
