	    		<h2>How It Started</h2>
	    		<p class="left">
	    		For the final stretch of our 4th year cloud computing course at SFU, 3 friends and I teamed up to tackle <a class="text-link dark" href="http://474.cmpt.sfu.ca/public/failtol.html">this assignment</a>. Throughout the semester, we had learned how to use EC2, DynamoDB, and SQS in our lessons. We were to write out a locally hosted <strong>front end</strong> and <strong>back end</strong> to coordinate messages going to and from Amazon SQS. The queueing system would provide a means of communication between the provided users and the 3 database instances we were attempting to run using DynamoDB. The <strong>ZooKeeper</strong> and <strong>Publish/Subscribe</strong> modules given would be means by which our databases would (or would not) cooperate.
	    		</p>
	    		<p class="left">
	    		This assignment's main objective was to learn how to keep multiple databases up to date with each other amidst <em>delayed, deleted, or out-of-order messages</em>, and I feel all of our team members have gained valuable experience from submitting this project.

	    		<h2 class="right">Game Plan</h2>
	    		<p class="right">
	    		All our team was given at the beginning was outlined in a diagram: Zookeeper, the messaging queues for SQS, a publish/subscribe framework, and request/response clients. Using SFU's in-house <strong>GitLab</strong> instance, we divided up work amongst ourselves according to our schedules and proficiencies: Kevin and Aaron were to handle how databases communicate with each other and the queues, Geoff would handle the DB logic itself, and I was in charge of the front and back end logic.
	    		</p>
	    		<p class="right">
	    		As things progressed, we found that some tasks and issues were being completed quicker than others. Workloads were underestimated, and other areas we finished quicker than expected. Plenty of discussion and re-assigning went on as we progressed to delivery.

	    		<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
	    		<p class="left">
	    		With the advent of widespread cloud computing and moving the burden of hardware maintenance to large data centers, software makers have found ways to save countless man-hours on keeping their machines running optimally. By doing so, however, we end up with new issues in latency and message delivery both within and outside of our systems. Are the databases still in sync? Have we dropped a critical message between some of our VMs? How will we deal with that?
	    		</p>
	    		<p class="left">
	    		Although the original milestones, comments and issue metadata were lost in the Gitlab migration, I hope the remaining records in our repository expose enough of the struggle we endured to complete this project.
