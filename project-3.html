	    		The final project for <a href="http://474.cmpt.sfu.ca/public/" class="text-link dark" target="_blank">CMPT 474</a>, a course centering on cloud computing and Amazon Web Services. Using a combination of knowledge from lessons on queueing, database management, and error handling, we were to synchronize the actions performed by 3 database processes amidst dropped, delayed, or out-of-order messages amongst them. Full assignment description is <a href="http://474.cmpt.sfu.ca/public/failtol.html" class="text-link dark" target="_blank">here</a>.

	    		<p class="right">
	    		This one was a <em>team effort</em>. In a group of 4 members including myself, we divided up the work and went at it. Our group needed someone to write the launcher script, someone to handle database actions, someone to cover communication between database instances, and someone to handle the web servers that would send or receive user messages via the bottle.py web server.

	    		<p class="left">
	    		When dealing with a 4th year course at SFU, you definitely don't want to mess around. Thankfully, the team I assembled was composed of close allies I knew I could trust from the beginning: my two friends Geoff(god1) and Kevin, as well as my own brother Aaron(ginzoya). Conveniently, we had 4 pairs of hands and 4 major tasks to focus on. Aaron volunteered to handle database logic, Kevin would write out functions to enqueue and dequeue messages from SQS, Geoff agreed to start working on the communication between DBs, and I handled the front/back ends with bottle.py.

	    		<h2 class="left">execution</h2>
	    		<p class="left">
	    		The technologies involved with this project were fairly simple. We were given code for tools called Zookeeper and &quot;Publish/Subscribe,&quot; which would allow our databases to communicate with each other. In addition to this, request clients and queues were also provided, but the functionality for orchestrating the whole operation was up to us.<br><br>

	    		As work progressed, we noticed some tasks were easier to complete than others. Particularly, the work I was assigned on the web front end and back end did not take long at all -- it ended up being a couple calls to push or pull JSON with Amazon's Simple Queueing Service. With my hands free of that, I could shift my focus to assisting the other members on their issues, whether it was advice and discussion on IM, or completing merge requests.<br><br>

	    		Thanks to our coordinated efforts, the project was delivered on time. We may have strayed from our original duties, but it was thanks to the shifting of hands that anything was completed at all.
	    		</p>

	    	<div class="col-6of12">
	    		<h2 class="right">reflection</h2>
	    		<p class="right">
	    		Things certainly didn't stick to the original plan very well, but the plan ended up being less significant in the long run. What mattered during this project was how we as a team reacted to rising issues, which I feel was handled very well. The moment any problem arose, someone would report it to the team's group chat so it could be dealt with. Of course, there were more tools provided by our repo for coordinating on problems.<br><br>

	    		Unfortunately in the migration from <strong>SFU's GitLab</strong> to <strong>Github</strong>, all of the issues and discussion threads we had made were lost. The features provided by issues, tagging, and assignment, however, proved to be invaluable to our problem-solving. Some issues persisted over the course of a night and we'd all fall asleep before it could be resolved. This wasn't a problem, though, because there would always be an issue with comments and an assignee to review in the morning.<br><br>

	    		Overall, this exercise was a good refresher on how to use the provided tools to collaborate on complicated projects. Though a task may be large, tools like GitLab and GitHub allow us to break things down into more manageable, trackable pieces.
