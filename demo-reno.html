	    		Opening a <em>New Tab</em> page in my browsers often showed a grid of things that the browser assumes I want to see. I'd rather have something that fits my needs a little bit more closely, since I frequent sites with many branching subsections, while also using web apps like Gmail.

	    		<p class="right">
	    		Make one! I've always wanted an excuse to try out a front-end framework, and I know a bit of JS already. There were some features that would be interesting to implement without too much trouble: some time-sensitive greetings, a live clock widget, and cascading link menus.

	    		<p class="left">
	    		As a solo project, there was a lot of freedom in deciding what requirements I'd set for myself, and how I'd go about fulfilling them. What I was looking for was fairly simple: menus with nested links, some large icons for frequent applications, a search bar, and maybe a bit of personalization. Many of the motivations for this project's requirements came from a mixture of features I <em>want to use</em>, and also <em>fun to implement</em>. If I was going to be making this, it might as well be a learning experience. To satisfy the requirements, I opted for a well-established framework, <a class="text-link dark" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/">Foundation 5</a>.

	    		<p class="left">
	    		Getting started with Foundation was not difficult in the slightest. After taking a zip with their utilities and acquiring a template, I was ready to begin. The framework itself has some very convenient base classes, and the availability of mix-ins (pre-made widgets provided by other users) only further sped the process along.<br><br>

	    		Within a couple of hours, the skeletal structure of the site had been completed: links were in, dropdowns were working, and the search bar functionality was online. While quick and easy, it wasn't exactly stimulating, so I reviewed the &quot;personalization&quot; requirement I set. What if the page greeted me based on the hour of day?<br><br>

	    		The personalization aspect ended up being a bit of fun to implement. This homepage project transitioned from a static page to a cheeky assistant, and the work revealed some handy JS functionality that I've ignored in the past. Being able to pull system time and force things through switch statements ended up bringing back some fond memories of my first Python projects, and I'm glad I followed through on the personalization requirement.

	    		<h2 class="right">reflection</h2>
	    		<p class="right">
	    		Home Sweet Homepage ended up being a very engaging way for me to spend time between semesters. Having an idea and being able to follow through with it was definitely a rewarding experience, especially when there are new toys to try out along the way.<br><br>

	    		Foundation itself proved to be much easier than I was bracing for. Working on front ends in the past (whether it was for school or work) was always a heavy task: grids had to be defined and debugged, style guides had to be written, and media query break points had to be tracked manually. The sheer convenience of a framework was certainly a welcome change, and because this project was personal, there was no worry for any performance overhead or feature-bloat, since I was the primary (and only) user.<br><br>

	    		The convenience factor, however, was not meant to last. A good friend of mine spotted me using my homepage, and asked if he could pull it for himself. Now, he and I are in the process of rebuilding Home Sweet Homepage from the ground up to be more modular, in case there are more users hunting for a more &quot;custom&quot; home page.
