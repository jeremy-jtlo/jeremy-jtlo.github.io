# Jeremy's Portfolio (Now on Github edition)<br/>
If you're reading this, then you found the source for my portfolio page.<br/>
Feel free to have a look around, take things apart, fork it, or anything<br/>
else you might want to do with it. The grid system I came up with here<br/>
isn't perfect, but I made do with what I had and the whole thing was thrown<br/>
together with less planning than I'd hoped. All of that's changing, though<br/>
and this repo will be where it all happens.
